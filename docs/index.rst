Overview
--------
**Quality Nexus** is a project that uses machine learning models to predict various manufacturing specifications. It helps predict production costs, defect statuses, and other specifications based on input data, aiming to streamline decision-making in manufacturing environments through predictive analytics.

Installation
------------
To install **Quality Nexus**, make sure you have **Python 3.11**, **3.10**, or **3.9**. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   .. code-block:: bash

4. **Install dependencies**:
   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----
There are three primary ways to interact with **Quality Nexus**:

1. **Predicting a Single Value**:
   - Use the Streamlit interface with sliders and input fields to predict a specific manufacturing specification (e.g., production cost or defect status).

2. **Editing a Whole DataFrame**:
   - Modify an entire dataset in a DataFrame format and make multiple predictions based on your adjustments.

3. **Uploading a CSV**:
   - Upload a CSV file containing data, and **Quality Nexus** will process it and generate predictions for each row.

API Reference
-------------
Currently, **Quality Nexus** does not rely on an external API. It is deployed as a **Streamlit** application, which allows direct interaction through the Streamlit interface.

Examples
--------
More usage examples will be provided soon. Stay tuned for updates!
