Overview
========

**Quality Nexus** is a project that uses machine learning models to predict various manufacturing specifications. It helps predict production costs, defect statuses, and other specifications based on input data, aiming to streamline decision-making in manufacturing environments through predictive analytics.

The purpose of Quality Nexus is to enable the visualization of how various external factors impact a key variable of interest. This allows users to identify the most influential factors and fine-tune them to achieve optimal outcomes.

The application also provides tools to estimate the effects of disruptions throughout the production process, focusing on key metrics such as Defect Rate and Quality Score.
